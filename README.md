Why Repetition = Impact:

Emotional resonance: Repeating keywords can enhance the emotional appeal of your message, which is essential for making a speech memorable and impactful. Emotions play a significant role in engagement, and a thoughtfully repeated phrase can evoke feelings of hope, anger, or inspiration.

Memorability: When a word or phrase is repeated, it becomes more likely to stay with the audience, thereby increasing the long-term impact of your message.

Cultural influence: Repeated phrases have the power to extend beyond the speech itself and become part of the broader culture. For example, slogans like "Yes we can" from Barack Obama's speeches have become widely recognized symbols of his campaign and presidency.

We are familiar with the significant impact of Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" and Winston Churchill's "We Shall Fight" speeches. Both have similarly moved people emotionally and left a lasting impression on our culture.

In Ted Cruz's marathon speech against ObamaCare, he opted not to yield for questions or interruptions from his colleagues, which allowed him to maintain control of the floor and speak uninterrupted throughout the entire duration. Interestingly, the phrase "do not yield" appeared quite frequently in his remarks, outnumbering references to terms like "the people" and "Texans".
